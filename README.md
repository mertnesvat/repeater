# Repeater - Spaced Repetition
Simple yet useful effortless brain training via research proven methods such as spaced repetition for any information you like! 

## TLDR; 
Our app helps you remember the information you want to learn through sending notifications that remind you about the information over increased time periods. Why increased time periods? Because of [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition)

## What is it?
"Never memorize something that you can look up." famous quote by Einstein, for all my life I tried to live like this untill recently my navigation was not working and I was almost lost at somewhere I don't know in the middle of the night. I started to think it wasn't that hard to remember places and things pre-google maps era. 

Obviously we are smarter with our phones and computers with an access to information waterfall but also it creates huge dependecy in terms of memory. You can ask yourself what was the last time you tried to remember something instead of writing it down somewhere. It was very rare for me and made me think am I turning to Fish memory! 

Fortunately the brain is very plastic and molds to whatever you need to do! That's why I tried memory improvement applications for sometime and I saw myself improvement. But many of them focus only on short term memory and not enough importance was placed on long term one memory.

The connection what I've just told you with the project is simple Repeater is try to improve long term memory by memorizing some poem, learning new language, even learning programming !
